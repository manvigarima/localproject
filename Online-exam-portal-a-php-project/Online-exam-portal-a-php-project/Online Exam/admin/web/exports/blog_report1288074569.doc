While the board exams&acirc;&euro;&trade; paper include the philoso&Acirc;&not;phy and content of various experienced teachers which may appear to be different then what you have done in your class. To score very high in such an exam the general&Acirc;&not;isation of your knowledge and concepts is an essential. All the engineering entrance exams are held a short while after the XII Board exams are over. So. the limited time length available is an obvious and biggest of all constraints.</p> </td></tr>
