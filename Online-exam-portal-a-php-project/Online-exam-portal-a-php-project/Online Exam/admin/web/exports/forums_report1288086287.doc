<p>Those who are good listeners with an interest in helping others may want to pursue the field of Counseling and Guidance. Since counseling is a broad field, counselors could work with students, families, married couples or substance abuse clients. One of the most common types of counseling is school counseling. School counselors help students find their own paths while providing help for behavioral, social and academic problems. They can also help students develop skills they may need during their college or professional years.</p> </td>
