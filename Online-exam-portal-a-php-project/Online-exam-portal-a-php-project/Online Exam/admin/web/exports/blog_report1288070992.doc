					<td>10 </td><td><p>This chapter introduces relations and functions. Functions will be the focus of most of the rest of algebra, as well as pre-calculus and calculus. This chapter is an important stepping stone to the rest of algebra.  Much of Algebra II and Calculus is concerned with the study of the properties of functions. Here, the student will graph functions, find their maximum and minimum values, and determine their attributes solely from their equations. Functions will be used to solve many different types of problems. However, one must first learn the basics--how to recognize a function, and how to determine its domain and range.</p> </td></tr><tr><td>XII </td><td>2</td><td>Inverse Trigonometric  Function   </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>The trigonometric functions are very important in technical subjects like science, engineering, architecture, and even medicine. You will come across trig functions all the time and you are encouraged to learn them well!
Surveying is one of the many applications. Road makers, bridge builders and those whose job it is to get buildings in the right place all use trigonometry in their daily work. 
The inverse trigonometric functions are useful in solving wide varieties of trigonometric functions. On calculators, they appear as sin-1, cos-1, tan-1, etc. This symbolism for the inverse of the functions should not be confused with negative exponents.

 </td></tr><tr><td>XII </td><td>3</td><td>Matrices    </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>This chapter introduces matrices as a way of representing data. Matrices will be used to organize data as well as to solve for variables.
Matrices are important in Algebra II, as we will see in the next chapter. They are used in multiple ways to solve systems of equations. In addition, they are important in higher algebra. A large portion of linear algebra, which you may study in college, deals entirely with matrices. Matrices are also used by mathematicians, physicists, and biologists to organize data and study complex phenomena; for example, matrices are used to study population growth and determine when a population will stabilize.
 </td></tr><tr><td>XII </td><td>4</td><td>Determinants     </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>Determinants are mathematical objects that are very useful in the analysis and solution of systems of linear equations. In algebra, the determinant is a special number associated to any square matrix, that is to say, a rectangular array of numbers where the (finite) number of rows and columns are equal. The fundamental geometric meaning of a determinant is a scale factor for measure when the matrix is regarded as a linear transformation. </td></tr><tr><td>XII </td><td>5</td><td>Continuity And Differentiability    </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>Differentiability as a property of a function at a specific point is presented along with a mention of its relationship to continuity. In calculus (a branch of mathematics) the derivative is a measure of how a function changes as its input changes. Loosely speaking, a derivative can be thought of as how much a quantity is changing at a given point; for example, the derivative of the position of a vehicle with respect to time is the instantaneous velocity at which the vehicle is traveling </td></tr><tr><td>XII </td><td>6</td><td>Application of Derivatives    </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>Differential calculus can be considered as mathematics of motion, growth and change where there is a motion, growth, change. Whenever there is variable forces producing acceleration, differential calculus is the right mathematics to apply. Application of derivatives are used to represent and interprete the rate at which quantities change with respect to another variable. Most of the changes are considered in terms of independent variable time. But there is no restriction that the changes are considered with respect to time only, as we have seen in the above mentioned, statements </td></tr><tr><td>XII </td><td>7</td><td>Integrals    </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>Integration is used in dealing with two essentially different types of problems:
	The first type are problems in which the derivative of a function, or its rate of change,
or the slope of its graph, is known and we want to find the function. We are therefore
required to reverse the process of differentiation. This reverse process is known as antidifferentiation, or finding a primitive function, or finding an indefinite integral.
	The second type are problems which involve adding up a very large number of very small quantities, (and then taking a limit as the size of the quantities approaches zero while
the number of terms tends to infinity). This process leads to the definition of the definite
integral. Definite integrals are used for finding area, volume, centre of gravity, moment of
inertia, work done by a force, and in many other applications.
 </td></tr><tr><td>XII </td><td>8</td><td>Applications of Integrals      </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>Equipped with the integral and able to calculate it for many functions, we can see some interesting applications, each arising from the notion of a limit of sums. The integral was first introduced with reference to the "area under the graph" of a function.
This will highlight, the crucial importance of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus as the place where the derivative and integral are able to knock a few sparks off each other to illuminate the calculus landscape.
 </td></tr><tr><td>XII </td><td>9</td><td>Differential Equations    </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>In high school, you studied algebraic equations like
	3x – 2(x – 4) = 5x, x2 – 8x + 15 = 0 and |6x – 2| = 4
The goal here was to solve the equation, which meant to find the value (or values) of the variable that makes the equation true.
In general, each type of algebraic equation had its own particular method of solution; quadratic equations were solved by one method, equations involving absolute values by another, and so on. In each case, an equation was presented (or arose from a word problem), and a certain method was employed to arrive at a solution, a method appropriate for the particular equation at hand.
These same general ideas carry over to differential equations, which are equations involving derivatives. There are different types of differential equations, and each type requires its own particular solution method.
 </td></tr><tr><td>XII </td><td>10</td><td>Vector  Algebra      </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>Vector algebra is much easier to apply than geometry and requires knowledge of fewer rules. 
The mechanics of vector algebra are straightforward, requiring less intuition and cleverness in finding a solution. (Remember those nasty geometry proofs from high school?)  
Vector algebra operations are much easier to express with familiar nomenclature.   (For example, the statement C = A + B is a typical vector algebra expression.)
Many of the rules learned in basic algebra also apply in vector algebra.   (For example, you can add the same vector to both sides of an equation, you can divide both sides of an equation by a number, and so on.)
 </td></tr><tr><td>XII </td><td>11</td><td>Three Dimensional Geometry     </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>We chiefly studied simple closed surfaces and, more specifically, polyhedrons. Remember, polyhedrons are surfaces made up entirely of polygons. The surfaces we studied rarely exist alone in the world--they are usually united with their interior points to form a three-dimensional solid, like a ball of clay, for example. Three-dimensional solids have measurements analogous to perimeter and area; they are called surface area and volume. Where perimeter is a measure of length only--it is a one- dimensional measure for figures of two dimensions--surface area is a measure solely of area, a two-dimensional measure of solids that exist in three dimensions. Both surfaces and solids have surface area. The surface area of a solid is simply the area of the surface that encloses it.  </td></tr><tr><td>XII </td><td>12</td><td>Linear Programming      </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>Linear programming is the process of taking various linear inequalities relating to some situation, and finding the "best" value obtainable under those conditions. A typical example would be taking the limitations of materials and labor, and then determining the "best" production levels for maximal profits under those conditions..In "real life", linear programming is part of a very important area of mathematics called "optimization techniques". This field of study (or at least the applied results of it) are used every day in the organization and allocation of resources. </td></tr><tr><td>XII </td><td>13</td><td>Probability   </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>Probability theory can be understood as a mathematical model for the intuitive notion of uncertainty. Without probability theory all the stochastic models in Physics, Biology, and Economics would either not have been developed or would not be rigorous. Also, probability is used in many branches of pure mathematics, even in branches one does not expect this, like in convex geometry. </td></tr><tr><td>XII </td><td>14</td><td>Model Papers </td>
