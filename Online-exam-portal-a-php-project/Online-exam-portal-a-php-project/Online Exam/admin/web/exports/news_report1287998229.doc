			<tr><td style='padding-left:5px;' align='justify'><p>Education for a New Era&rdquo; is Qatar&rsquo;s modern, world-class education system. Best practices from around the world combined with Qatar&rsquo;s unique culture are ensuring a bright future for every child &ndash; and the strong competitive growth of our nation. The Supreme Education Council is responsible for education policy in Qatar. Along with its three institutes, it oversees education reform, helps it grow, and objectively monitors its progress. Membership in the Council is drawn from Qatar&rsquo;s top leaders in government, business, and academia.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;At the heart of education reform are autonomous government-funded Independent Schools; internationally-benchmarked curriculum standards in Arabic, English, mathematics, and science; and assessments and other evaluation tools to measure student learning and school performance. Education for a New Era is built on four principles:<br /><br /><strong>Autonomy:</strong> Allowing schools and teachers to be innovative in their approach to meeting the needs of individual students and parents within the framework of the curriculum standards. Today, more than 100 independent schools offer new models for curriculum design, teaching methods, and collaboration. By 2010, all public schools in Qatar will be independent schools.</p><br />
<p><strong>Accountability:</strong> Implementing an objective and transparent assessment system to hold all school leaders, teachers and parents responsible for the success of students. The Qatar Comprehensive Evaluation Assessment (QCEA) is administered annually to students in every independent school and all schools are reviewed every three years.<br /><br /><strong>Variety:</strong> Encouraging different kinds of schools and instructional programs.<br /><br /><strong>Choice:</strong> Allowing parents to select the school that best fits their child&rsquo;s needs and seeking their input on important schools decisions. To further encourage choice, a voucher program was instituted in 2008, offering vouchers to parents to use in a select group of private schools that meet rigorous criteria for quality.</p> </td></tr>

			<tr><td><strong>Status : active</strong> </td></tr>
			<tr><td style='padding-left:5px;' align='justify'><p>The Evaluation Institute of the Supreme Education Council has released the first of three studies discussing factors that affect educational outcomes for students in independent, former Ministry of Education and private Arabic schools in Qatar. The research study drew on data available through routine collections from 2005-06, 2006-07 and 2007-08 academic years.<br /><br />&ldquo;Students in Qatar come from diverse backgrounds and face many challenges throughout their studies,&rdquo; said Adel Al Sayed, the director of the Evaluation Institute. &ldquo;This study shows the Evaluation Institute&rsquo;s commitment to providing the community with high quality and research relevant to the educational outcomes of our students in Qatar.&rdquo;<br /><br />Of the three studies conducted, two were based on student level data while the third covered school level data. The studies looked at a number of background variables in relation students Qatar Comprehensive Educational Assessment (QCEA) results. These included the highest level of education completed by either parent, student gender, parent participation in school activities, parent participation in their student&rsquo;s homework, parent perception of the happiness of their child at school, parent satisfaction with the school, the level of home spending on education, the number and type of other selected resources available in the home, and the level of school resources. Below is a summary of some of the findings<br /><br />Variation between schools and between students Variation in student outcomes can be divided into differences between schools, and differences between students within schools. In Qatar, as in many countries, the differences in the students&rsquo; results within schools are much greater than the differences between schools&rsquo; average results.<br /><br />Parents&rsquo; education One of the most consistent findings is that student-learning outcomes are linked with the level of parental education. In general, students with highly educated parents achieve higher results. This is true for all grades, all subjects and in all years. This association is strongest for parental education up to the level of a bachelor&rsquo;s degree. Students who have a parent with a higher degree do not, on average, perform any better than those whose parents have only a bachelor&rsquo;s degree.<br /><br />Schools where the proportion of parents who have at least a bachelor&rsquo;s degree is high, have higher average student results overall.<br /><br /></p> </td></tr>
