					<td>0 </td><td><p>This chapter introduces relations and functions. Functions will be the focus of most of the rest of algebra, as well as pre-calculus and calculus. This chapter is an important stepping stone to the rest of algebra.  Much of Algebra II and Calculus is concerned with the study of the properties of functions. Here, the student will graph functions, find their maximum and minimum values, and determine their attributes solely from their equations. Functions will be used to solve many different types of problems. However, one must first learn the basics--how to recognize a function, and how to determine its domain and range.</p> </td></tr><tr><td>XII </td><td>2</td><td>Inverse Trigonometric  Function </td>
					<td>0 </td><td><p>The trigonometric functions are very important in technical subjects like science, engineering, architecture, and even medicine. You will come across trig functions all the time and you are encouraged to learn them well! Surveying is one of the many applications. Road makers, bridge builders and those whose job it is to get buildings in the right place all use trigonometry in their daily work.  The inverse trigonometric functions are useful in solving wide varieties of trigonometric functions. On calculators, they appear as sin-1, cos-1, tan-1, etc. This symbolism for the inverse of the functions should not be confused with negative exponents.</p> </td></tr><tr><td>XII </td><td>3</td><td>Matrices    </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>This chapter introduces matrices as a way of representing data. Matrices will be used to organize data as well as to solve for variables.
Matrices are important in Algebra II, as we will see in the next chapter. They are used in multiple ways to solve systems of equations. In addition, they are important in higher algebra. A large portion of linear algebra, which you may study in college, deals entirely with matrices. Matrices are also used by mathematicians, physicists, and biologists to organize data and study complex phenomena; for example, matrices are used to study population growth and determine when a population will stabilize.
 </td></tr><tr><td>XII </td><td>4</td><td>Determinants     </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>Determinants are mathematical objects that are very useful in the analysis and solution of systems of linear equations. In algebra, the determinant is a special number associated to any square matrix, that is to say, a rectangular array of numbers where the (finite) number of rows and columns are equal. The fundamental geometric meaning of a determinant is a scale factor for measure when the matrix is regarded as a linear transformation. </td></tr><tr><td>XII </td><td>5</td><td>Continuity And Differentiability    </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>Differentiability as a property of a function at a specific point is presented along with a mention of its relationship to continuity. In calculus (a branch of mathematics) the derivative is a measure of how a function changes as its input changes. Loosely speaking, a derivative can be thought of as how much a quantity is changing at a given point; for example, the derivative of the position of a vehicle with respect to time is the instantaneous velocity at which the vehicle is traveling </td></tr><tr><td>XII </td><td>6</td><td>Application of Derivatives    </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>Differential calculus can be considered as mathematics of motion, growth and change where there is a motion, growth, change. Whenever there is variable forces producing acceleration, differential calculus is the right mathematics to apply. Application of derivatives are used to represent and interprete the rate at which quantities change with respect to another variable. Most of the changes are considered in terms of independent variable time. But there is no restriction that the changes are considered with respect to time only, as we have seen in the above mentioned, statements </td></tr><tr><td>XII </td><td>7</td><td>Integrals    </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>Integration is used in dealing with two essentially different types of problems:
	The first type are problems in which the derivative of a function, or its rate of change,
or the slope of its graph, is known and we want to find the function. We are therefore
required to reverse the process of differentiation. This reverse process is known as antidifferentiation, or finding a primitive function, or finding an indefinite integral.
	The second type are problems which involve adding up a very large number of very small quantities, (and then taking a limit as the size of the quantities approaches zero while
the number of terms tends to infinity). This process leads to the definition of the definite
integral. Definite integrals are used for finding area, volume, centre of gravity, moment of
inertia, work done by a force, and in many other applications.
 </td></tr><tr><td>XII </td><td>8</td><td>Applications of Integrals      </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>Equipped with the integral and able to calculate it for many functions, we can see some interesting applications, each arising from the notion of a limit of sums. The integral was first introduced with reference to the "area under the graph" of a function.
This will highlight, the crucial importance of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus as the place where the derivative and integral are able to knock a few sparks off each other to illuminate the calculus landscape.
 </td></tr><tr><td>XII </td><td>9</td><td>Differential Equations    </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>In high school, you studied algebraic equations like
	3x – 2(x – 4) = 5x, x2 – 8x + 15 = 0 and |6x – 2| = 4
The goal here was to solve the equation, which meant to find the value (or values) of the variable that makes the equation true.
In general, each type of algebraic equation had its own particular method of solution; quadratic equations were solved by one method, equations involving absolute values by another, and so on. In each case, an equation was presented (or arose from a word problem), and a certain method was employed to arrive at a solution, a method appropriate for the particular equation at hand.
These same general ideas carry over to differential equations, which are equations involving derivatives. There are different types of differential equations, and each type requires its own particular solution method.
 </td></tr><tr><td>XII </td><td>10</td><td>Vector  Algebra      </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>Vector algebra is much easier to apply than geometry and requires knowledge of fewer rules. 
The mechanics of vector algebra are straightforward, requiring less intuition and cleverness in finding a solution. (Remember those nasty geometry proofs from high school?)  
Vector algebra operations are much easier to express with familiar nomenclature.   (For example, the statement C = A + B is a typical vector algebra expression.)
Many of the rules learned in basic algebra also apply in vector algebra.   (For example, you can add the same vector to both sides of an equation, you can divide both sides of an equation by a number, and so on.)
 </td></tr><tr><td>XII </td><td>11</td><td>Three Dimensional Geometry     </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>We chiefly studied simple closed surfaces and, more specifically, polyhedrons. Remember, polyhedrons are surfaces made up entirely of polygons. The surfaces we studied rarely exist alone in the world--they are usually united with their interior points to form a three-dimensional solid, like a ball of clay, for example. Three-dimensional solids have measurements analogous to perimeter and area; they are called surface area and volume. Where perimeter is a measure of length only--it is a one- dimensional measure for figures of two dimensions--surface area is a measure solely of area, a two-dimensional measure of solids that exist in three dimensions. Both surfaces and solids have surface area. The surface area of a solid is simply the area of the surface that encloses it.  </td></tr><tr><td>XII </td><td>12</td><td>Linear Programming      </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>Linear programming is the process of taking various linear inequalities relating to some situation, and finding the "best" value obtainable under those conditions. A typical example would be taking the limitations of materials and labor, and then determining the "best" production levels for maximal profits under those conditions..In "real life", linear programming is part of a very important area of mathematics called "optimization techniques". This field of study (or at least the applied results of it) are used every day in the organization and allocation of resources. </td></tr><tr><td>XII </td><td>13</td><td>Probability   </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>Probability theory can be understood as a mathematical model for the intuitive notion of uncertainty. Without probability theory all the stochastic models in Physics, Biology, and Economics would either not have been developed or would not be rigorous. Also, probability is used in many branches of pure mathematics, even in branches one does not expect this, like in convex geometry. </td></tr><tr><td>XII </td><td>14</td><td>Model Papers </td>

					<td>0 </td><td>In Mathematics, a well-defined collection of definite objects is called a set. This chapter introduces some basic definitions and operations involving sets. The concept of set serves as a fundamental part of the present day mathematics. The concept of "Sets" is basic in all branches of mathematics. Sets are used to define the concepts of relations and functions. It has proved to be of particular importance in the foundations of sequences, geometry, probability theory etc. The study of sets has many applications in logic, philosophy, etc.  </td></tr><tr><td>XII </td><td>1</td><td>Intro </td>

					<td>0 </td><td>In this Unit we are introducing Trigonometry and trigonometric Identities with heights and Distances. We will study some ratios of the sides of a right triangle with respect to its acute angles, called trigonometric ratios of the angles. We will also define the trigonometric ratios for angles of measure 0 and 90 degrees,and calculating trigonometric ratios for some specific angles and establish some identities involving these ratios, called trigonometric identities. Finally we will see how trigonometry is used for finding the heights and distances of various objects, without actually measuring them. </td></tr><tr><td>X </td><td>4</td><td>Coordinate geometry   </td>

And finally we shall see about the division of a line segment. </td></tr><tr><td>X </td><td>6</td><td>Mensuration   </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>In this Unit we will be studying the Areas related to circles, Surface areas and volumes. In areas related to circles we will begin our discussion with a review of the concepts of perimeter(circumference) and area of a circle and apply this knowledge in finding the areas of two special ‘parts’ of a circular region known as sector and segment. We shall also see how to find the areas of some combinations of plane figures involving circles or their parts. And we will also see how to find the surface areas and volumes of the same figures in the chapter of surface areas and volumes. </td></tr><tr><td>X </td><td>7</td><td>Statistics and probability   </td>

We shall also discuss the concept of cumulative frequency, the cumulative frequency distribution and how to draw cumulative frequency curves, called ogives. In Probability we provide an introduction to the theoretical probability of an event, and discuss simple problems based on this concept. </td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>2</td><td>Relations and Functions   </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>This chapter deals how to link pairs of objects from two sets and then introduce relations between the two objects in the pair. It also deals about special relations which will qualify to be functions. The concept of function is very important in mathematics since it captures the idea of a mathematically precise correspondence between one quantity with the other. </td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>3</td><td>Trigonometric Function   </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>This chapter generalizes the concept of trigonometric ratios to trigonometric functions and their properties. Currently, trigonometry is used in many areas such as the science of seismology, designing electric circuits, describing the state of an atom, predicting the heights of tides in the ocean, analyzing a musical tone and in many other areas. The trigonometric functions are very important in technical subjects like science, engineering, architecture, and even medicine. You will come across trig functions all the time and you are encouraged to learn them well! </td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>4</td><td>Mathematical Induction and  Reasoning   </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>This chapter introduces some basic ideas of Mathematical Induction and Reasoning. 
The word Induction means method of reasoning from individual cases to general ones or from observed instances to unobserved ones. Many important mathematical formulae are such that a result is formed by some means which does not provide for a direct proof. Mathematical Induction is a principle by which one can arrive at a conclusion about a statement for all positive integers, after proving certain related proposition. It is frequently used in mathematics and is a key aspect of scientific reasoning, where collecting and analyzing data is the norm. </td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>5</td><td>Complex number and Quadratic equation   </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>This chapter introduces methods of solving quadratic equations as well as the logic underlying each method. Factoring, extraction of roots, completing the square, and the quadratic formula are carefully developed. This chapter also introduces complex numbers. The set of all complex numbers is denoted by C and the nomenclature of a complex number was introduced by C.F. Gauss, a German mathematician. The extension of the concept of numbers from real numbers enables one to solve any polynomial equation. </td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>6</td><td> Linear Inequalities    </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>This chapter introduces linear inequalities in one and two variables. It helps in making decisions about how much of a certain item you can afford, given a fixed amount of money. Inequalities are applicable in many real-world situations. The study of inequalities is very useful in solving problems in the field of science, mathematics, statistics, optimisation problems, economics, psychology, etc. </td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>7</td><td>Permutation and combinations </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>This chapter deals with concepts required for the study of probability and statistics. Permutations and Combinations are used in both statistics and probability; and they, in turn, involve operations with factorial notation. The techniques of permutations and combinations will be useful in determining the number of different ways of arranging and selecting objects without actually listing them. </td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>8</td><td>Binomial Theorem    </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>This chapter deals with binomial theorem for positive integral indices. Prior to the discussion of binomial expansion, this chapter will present Pascal s Triangle. It is used in statistics to calculate the binomial distribution. This allows statisticians to determine the probability of a given number of favorable outcomes in a repeated number of trials. Binomial expansion is also interesting from a mathematical point of view--it gives mathematicians insight into the properties of polynomials. </td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>9</td><td>Sequence and Series   </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>This chapter begins by discussing the concept of a sequence. Intuitively, a sequence is an ordered list of objects or events. Mostly this chapter deals with sequences of numbers. 
Sequences and series, whether they be arithmetic or geometric, have may applications to situations you may not think of as being related to sequences or series. In order to work with these application problems you need to make sure you have a basic understanding of arithmetic sequences, arithmetic series, geometric sequences and geometric series. </td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>10</td><td>Straight lines    </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>This chapter deals with properties of the simplest geometric figure – straight line. Despite its simplicity, the line is a vital concept of geometry and enters into our daily experiences in numerous interesting and useful ways. Main focus is on representing the line algebraically, for
which slope is most essential.  </td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>11</td><td>Conic Sections   </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>This chapter deals with circles, ellipses, parabolas and hyperbolas. The names parabola and hyperbola are given by Apollonius. These curves are in fact, known as conic sections or more commonly conics because they can be obtained as intersections of a plane with a double napped right circular cone. These curves have a very wide range of applications in fields such as planetary motion, design of telescopes and antennas, reflectors in
flashlights and automobile headlights, etc.  </td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>12</td><td> Introduction to three dimensional Geometry   </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>The three numbers representing the three distances are called the coordinates of the point with reference to the three coordinate planes. So, a point in space has three coordinates. This chapter deals with the basic concepts of geometry in three dimensional space. </td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>13</td><td>Limits and Derivatives     </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>This chapter is an introduction to Calculus. Calculus is that branch of mathematics which mainly deals with change in the value of a function as the points in the domain change. First, it gives an intuitive idea of derivative (without actually defining it). Then it gives a naive definition of limit and study some algebra of limits. Then it introduces the definition of derivative and the algebra of derivatives. </td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>14</td><td>Statistics   </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>Statistics deals with data collected for specific purposes. A measure of central tendency gives us a rough idea where data points are centred. But, in order to make better interpretation from the data, we should also have an idea how the data are scattered or how much they are bunched around a measure of central tendency. The measures of central tendency are not sufficient to give complete information about a given data. Variability is another factor which is required to be studied under statistics. Like ‘measures of central tendency’ we want to have a single number to describe variability. This single number is called a ‘measure of dispersion’. This chapter deals with important measures of dispersion and their methods of calculation for ungrouped and grouped data. </td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>15</td><td>Probability   </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>The word probability and chance are quite familiar to everyone. The word chance, possible, probably, likely etc. convey some sense of uncertainty about the occurrence of some events. Our entire world is filled with uncertainty. We make decisions affected by uncertainty virtually every day. In order to think about and measure uncertainty, we turn to a branch of mathematics called probability.
This chapter introduces the approach called axiomatic approach of probability. To understand this approach we must know about few basic terms such as random experiment, sample space, events, etc.  </td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>16</td><td>Model Papers </td>

					<td>0 </td><td>This lesson is designed to introduce students to compare two quantities.
Different ratios can also be compared with each other to know whether they are equivalent or not. It is good to know if one number is bigger, smaller or the same as another number! Percentages are widely used in our daily life, This chapter helps to find exact number when a certain per cent of the total quantity is given. </td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>1</td><td>Algebraic Expressions     </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>Expressions are a central concept in algebra. This Chapter is devoted to algebraic expressions. When you have studied this Chapter, you will know how algebraic expressions are formed, how they can be combined, how we can find their values and how they can be used. </td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>3</td><td>Data Handling   </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>Data handling is an art. Sometimes the raw data (data as they are) will not be useful to get the required information. In order to get proper and useful information, we have to process the data. Very important useful information from the given data is average. This chapter also includes a Bar graph and double bar graph which helps to compare two collections of data at a glance. </td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>4</td><td>Exponents And Powers   </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>Very large numbers are difficult to read, understand, compare and operate upon. To make all these easier, we use exponents, converting many of the large numbers in a shorter form .This chapter also discuss about the laws of exponents and the problems are solved based on this. </td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>5</td><td>Fractions and Decimals     </td>

This chapter also discusses about the multiplication of two decimal numbers and division of two decimal numbers. </td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>6</td><td>Integers   </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>This chapter discusses more about integers, their properties and operations. Integers are a set of numbers that include all the natural numbers (0, 1, 2, 3 , 4, and so on) and their negatives. Integers include positive and negative numbers and zero (zero is neither positive nor negative). There are an infinite number of integers, since no matter how large an integer you can name, you can always get a larger one by adding one to it. The integers are the set of whole numbers and their opposites. This chapter also discusses the problems based on its properties. </td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>7</td><td>Lines And Angles   </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>This chapter deals about different types of angles related to lines, line segments, rays and transversal and its related problems. </td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>8</td><td>Perimeter & Area   </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>Area and perimeter are two important and fundamental parts of mathematics.  The unit and topics of area and perimeter are important to mathematics because they are the physical aspects of mathematics.  They are the foundation for understanding other aspects of geometry such as volume and mathematical theorems. A perimeter is a path that surrounds an area. This chapter also includes Area of triangle, circles, parallelogram and the problems are solved based on this. </td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>9</td><td>Rational Numbers   </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>All integers and fractions are rational numbers.Rational numbers are classified as Positive and Negative rational numbers. The number 0 is neither a positive nor a negative rational number.

practical situations and also deals in finding solution of the equations </td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>11</td><td>Symmetry   </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>Symmetry is an important geometrical concept, commonly exhibited in nature and is used almost in every field of activity. Artists, professionals, designers of clothing or jewelers, car manufacturers, architects and many others make use of the idea of symmetry. The beehives, the flowers, the tree-leaves, religious symbols, rugs, and handkerchiefs — everywhere you find symmetrical designs. Most definitions of symmetry refer to the ways in which a pattern repeats, is balanced, or is similar in shape to itself. </td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>12</td><td>Triangles   </td>

					<td>0 </td><td> </td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>1</td><td>Knowing the numbers   </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>We can count objects in large numbers, for example, the number of students in the school, and represent them through numerals. We use numbers and know many things about them. Numbers help us count concrete objects. They help us to say which collection of objects is bigger and arrange them in order e.g., first, second, etc. Numbers are used in many different contexts and in many ways. This chapter deals about some interesting thing about the numbers. </td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>2</td><td>Whole numbers   </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>The term whole number is one you’ll find often in mathematics. You may also see the term integers or natural numbers used in the same manner. Essentially the definition of a whole number is based around what it doesn t contain. A whole number can’t be a fraction of a number, a percentage, or have a decimal. This chapter deals with representing basic operation of a whole numbers on a numberline. It also introduces the basic properties of whole numbers. </td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>3</td><td>Playing with numbers   </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>The general form of numbers are helpful in solving puzzles or number games.

It also explores the relationship between digits of the numbers and their divisibility by different numbers. </td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>4</td><td>Understanding the elementary shapes   </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>All the shapes we see around us are formed using curves or lines. We can see corners, edges, planes, open curves and closed curves in our surroundings. We organise them into line segments, angles, triangles, polygons and circles which are discussed briefly in this chapter.  </td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>5</td><td>Integers   </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>An integer is a whole number (not a fraction) that can be positive, negative, or zero. Therefore, the numbers 10, 0, -25, and 5,148 are all integers. Unlike floating point numbers, integers cannot have decimal places. This chapter explains about integer and its operation. </td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>6</td><td>Data Handling   </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>A data is a collection of numbers gathered to give some information. This chapter deals with representing data using different types of graphs such as Pictograph and Bar graphs. It also explains how the interpretation of data can be made. </td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>7</td><td> Fraction   </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>A fraction is a number representing a part of a whole. The whole may be a single object or a group of objects. When expressing a situation of counting parts to write a fraction, it must be ensured that all parts are equal. This chapter deals with representing fractions on a number line and different types of fractions. </td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>8</td><td>Mensuration   </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>When we talk about some plane figures, we think of their regions and their boundaries. We need some measures to compare them. The concept Mensuration helps to learn about the measuring of area and perimeter of an object or a region.  </td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>9</td><td>Algebra   </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>Algebra is branch of mathematics. The main feature of the new branch which we are going to study is the use of letters. Use of letters will allow us to write rules and formulas in a general way. By learning methods of determining unknowns, we develop powerful tools for solving puzzles and many problems from daily life. This chapter deals with algebraic expressions and their properties. You will find algebra interesting and useful. It is very useful in solving problems. </td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>10</td><td>Decimals   </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>Decimals are used in many ways in our lives. For example, in representing units of
money, length and weight. This chapter deals with representing decimals on a number line and comparison between decimals. </td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>11</td><td>Ratio and proportion    </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>In our daily life, many a times we compare two quantities of the same type. For comparison we use the concept called Ratio and proportion we compared the two quantities in terms of ‘how many times’. This chapter deals about the concept of ratios and proportions and its rule. </td></tr><tr><td>VIII </td><td>1</td><td>Rational Numbers   </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>In Mathematics, we frequently come across simple equations to be solved. One may think that we have enough numbers to solve all simple equations with the available list of integers. Consider the equations 2x = 3 for which we cannot find a solution from the integers. This leads us to the collection of rational numbers. This chapter deals with some properties of operations on the different types of numbers. </td></tr><tr><td>VIII </td><td>2</td><td>Linear Equation   </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>Equations use the equality (=) sign; it is missing in expressions. Moreover, the expressions we use to form equations are linear. This means that the highest power of the variable appearing in the expression is 1.  This chapter deals with equations with linear expressions in one variable only. Such equations are known as linear equations in one variable. </td></tr><tr><td>VIII </td><td>3</td><td> Understanding Quadrilaterals   </td>

					<td>0 </td><td>Electrochemistry is the study of production of electricity from energy released during spontaneous chemical reactions and the use of electrical energy to bring about non-spontaneous  chemical transformations. Batteries and fuel cells convert chemical energy into electrical energy and are used on a large scale in various instruments and devices. The reactions carried out electrochemically can be energy efficient and less polluting. Therefore, study of electrochemistry is important for creating new technologies that are ecofriendly. The transmission of sensory signals through cells to brain and vice versa and communication between the cells are known to have electrochemical origin. Electrochemistry is therefore, a very vast and interdisciplinary subject. </td></tr><tr><td>XII </td><td>4</td><td>Chemical Kinetics    </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>The branch of chemistry, which deals with the study of reaction rates and their mechanisms, called chemical kinetics. The word kinetics is derived from the Greek word ‘kinesis’ meaning movement. Thermodynamics tells only about the feasibility of a reaction whereas chemical kinetics tells about the rate of a reaction. For example, thermodynamic data indicate that diamond shall convert to graphite but in reality the conversion rate is so slow that the change is not perceptible at all. Therefore, most people think that diamond is forever. Kinetic studies not only help us to determine
the speed or rate of a chemical reaction but also describe the conditions by which the reaction rates can be altered. dealing with average and instantaneous rate of reaction and the factors affecting these. Some elementary ideas about the collision theory of reaction rates are also given

					<td>0 </td><td>Surface chemistry deals with phenomena that occur at the surfaces or interfaces. The interface or surface is represented by separating the bulk phases by a hyphen or a slash. For example, the interface between a solid and a gas may be represented by solid-gas or solid/gas. Due to complete miscibility, there is no interface between the gases. The bulk phases that w  come across in surface chemistry may be pure compounds or solutions. The interface is normally a few molecules thick but its area depends on the size of the particles of bulk phases.This chapter includes some important features of surface chemistry such as adsorption, catalysis and colloids including emulsions and gels. </td></tr><tr><td>XII </td><td>6</td><td>General principles & isolation of metals     </td>

Still, some general principles are common to all the extraction processes of metals. For obtaining a particular metal, first we look for minerals which are naturally occurring chemical substances in the earth’s crust obtainable by mining. Out of many minerals in which a metal may be found, only a few are viable to be used as sources of that metal. Such minerals are known as ores.This chapter describes the principles of some of the common metallurgical processes. Those principles shall include the thermodynamic and electrochemical aspects involved in the effective reduction of the concentrated ore to the metal. </td></tr><tr><td>XII </td><td>7</td><td>P-block elements combined       </td>

The properties of p-block elements like that of others are greatly influenced by atomic sizes, ionisation enthalpy, electron gain enthalpy and electronegativity. The absence of d orbitals in second period and presence of d and/or f orbitals in heavier elements (starting from third period onwards) have significant effects on the properties of elements. In addition, the presence of all the three types of elements; metals, metalloids and non-metals bring diversification in chemistry of these elements. </td></tr><tr><td>XII </td><td>8</td><td>D and F block elements    </td>

					<td>0 </td><td>One or more hydrogen atom(s) from a hydrocarbon by another atom or a group of atoms result in the formation of an entirely new compound having altogether different properties  and applications. Alcohols and phenols are formed when a hydrogen atom in a hydrocarbon, aliphatic and aromatic respectively, is replaced by –OH group. The subsitution of a hydrogen atom in a hydrocarbon by an alkoxy or aryloxy group (R–O/Ar–O) yields another class of compounds known as ‘ethers’, for example, CH3OCH3 (dimethyl ether). In aldehydes, the carbonyl group is bonded to a carbon and hydrogen while in the ketones, it is bonded to two carbon atoms. The carbonyl compounds in which carbonyl group is bonded to oxygen are known as carboxylic acids, and their derivatives (e.g. esters, anhydrides) while in compounds where carbon is attached to nitrogen and to halogens are called  amides and acyl halides respectively. </td></tr><tr><td>XII </td><td>12</td><td>Nitrogen    </td>

					<td>0 </td><td>This chapter introduces the term chemistry. Chemistry is the study of the materials that make up the universe and the changes which these materials undergo. The term materials indicate the matters which are having specific uses.   All around us are substances that are made of matter. Matter has mass and occupies some space. This chapter also includes different laws which are explains us the relation between the mass of reactants and the products during chemical changes and the composition of various elements in a compound. </td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>2</td><td>Atomic structure   </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>John Daltons Atomic theory in 1890, was the first definite theory on the structure of matter. It summarised that all matter was composed of indivisible and extremely small structureless, hard, spherical particles called atoms. However, later discoveries at the turn of the 20th century showed that atoms had still a further complex structure and consisted of smaller particles called electrons, protons and neutrons. These were considered the fundamental particles of all atoms. </td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>3</td><td>Classification of elements & periodicity in properties     </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>With the rapid development of Chemistry and the discovery of new elements, it was necessary to develop a simple way to study and remember the numerous properties of the elements and their compounds. This gave rise to the necessity of classification of the elements into various groups having similar properties. This classification of elements resulted in the formulation of the Periodic Table, where the elements are arranged according to their properties in a tabular form. </td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>4</td><td>Chemical bonding & molecular structure    </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>It introduces the concepts of ionic and covalent bonding. Ionic and covalent bonds differ in the extent to which a pair of electrons is shared by the atoms that form the bond. Covalent bonds are characterized by certain parameters such as bond length, bond angle and bond energy. With increase in bond order, bond enthalpy increases and bond length decreases.This chapter includes VSEPR theory and hybridisation. The structures of different molecules can be explained on the basis of hybridization. </td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>5</td><td>States of matter   </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>The classification of matter into three different states, namely solid, liquid and gaseous state is termed as the physical classification of matter. Most properties of solid, liquid and gases that can be observed with our sense organs are called as macroscopic properties. The description of the behaviour of the three states of matter in terms of atomic theory is called microscopic description of matter. This chapter explains how bulk of materials arises from the behaviour of individual particles like atoms, ions or molecules.  </td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>6</td><td>Thermodynamics    </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>   The branch of chemistry, which deals with energy changes during various physical processes and chemical reactions, is called chemical energetics. All chemical reactions are normally accompanied by energy changes. These energy changes take place because energy is needed to break chemical bonds, and energy is released when new bonds are formed. In the process of chemical reaction, rearrangement of atoms in reactants takes place, to give products. This test_chapters explains us how to determine energy changes occurring during a chemical reaction or process ,what makes the chemical reaction or process to occur and to what extent do the chemical reactions or processes proceed. </td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>7</td><td>Equilibrium    </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>The state of reversible reaction at which the concentrations of reactants and products do not change with time is called a state of chemical equilibrium. Equilibrium can be established in both physical processes and chemical reactions. This chapter includes the application of equilibrium and factors that affect the state of equilibrium. It also explains Ionic Equilibrium in Solutions, Arrhenius concept of acids and bases, Bronsted Lowry concept, Lewis concept of Acids and bases. </td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>8</td><td>Redox reactions & electro chemistry      </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>Redox reactions, or oxidation-reduction reactions, primarily involve the transfer of electrons between two chemical species.These reactions are very common in our daily life. A large number of chemical and biological reactions like generation of electricity in dry and wet batteries, digestion of food in animals are the examples for redox reactions.
This chapter explains about the classification of the reactions and electrochemical cells.
The reactions can be classified into two types like oxidation and reduction reaction.
The electrochemical cell is a device used to convert energy produced in a redox reaction into electrical energy.

					<td>0 </td><td>Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe. It is the first element in the periodic table and is the lightest known element. It was discovered by Henry Cavendish in 1766. It exists as a diatomic molecule H2. Its name hydrogen was proposed because it produces water on burning with oxygen. This chapter includes isotopes of hydrogen. Isotopes are the different forms of the same element which have the same atomic number but different mass numbers. The molecule of water consists of two hydrogen atoms bonded to oxygen atom by covalent bond. Water is essential to all forms of life. It is most common, abundant 
and easily obtainable of all chemical compounds.

S-orbital cal accommodate only two electrons, this block includes only two groups group 1 and group 2. They have one or two electrons in their outermost s-subshell respectively. These two groups of s-block illustrate more clearly than any other group of elements, the effects of increasing the size of 
atoms or ions on the physical and chemical properties. This chapter includes the occurrence and properties of alkali metals and alkaline earth metals.
 </td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>3</td><td>How do organisms Reproduce </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>The creation of a life form, by a similar life is called reproduction. Reproduction is the extension of life of a species at a given time. It is a means of perpetuation of the species and also multiplies their number. By this process, the individuals transmit life to the next generation and thereby ensure the continued existence of living organisms on earth. If there was no reproduction, life on this earth would sooner or later come to an end. </td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>12</td><td>Hydrocarbons     </td>

Replacing a hydrogen atom by a OH group in a hydrocarbon, gives an alcohol: replacement of H atom in a hydrocarbon by COOH group gives in a hydrocarbon carboxylic acid, and so on. It is therefore appropriate to begin the study of hydrocarbons with its preparation, properties and reactions. Hydrocarbons are also used for the manufacture of polymers such as polythene , polypropene etc. </td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>13</td><td>Environmental chemistry    </td>

Gaseous materials like Oxygen, Nitrogen and Carbon dioxide are found in the atmosphere. Common salt and various other salts of sodium, magnesium and calcium are found dissolved in water bodies, like the oceans, rivers and lakes. There are about 103 elements, 92 of which are naturally occurring. Metals and non-metals are characterized by distinctly different physical and chemical properties.

Food, clothes, medicines, books, or many of the things that you listed are all based on this versatile element carbon. In addition, all living structures are carbon based. The amount of carbon present in the earth’s crust and in the atmosphere is quite meagre. The earth’s crust has only 0.02% carbon in the form of minerals (like carbonates, hydrogencarbonates, coal and petroleum) and the atmosphere has 0.03% of carbon dioxide.

As different elements were being discovered, scientists gathered more and more information about the properties of these elements. They found it difficult to organise all that was known about the elements. They started looking for some pattern in their properties, on the basis of which they could study such a large number of elements with ease. </td></tr><tr><td>X </td><td>6</td><td>Model Paper </td>

The air we breathe, the food we eat, stones, clouds, stars, plants and animals, even a small drop of water or a particle of sand– each thing is matter. We can also see as we look around that all the things mentioned above occupy space, that is, volume and have mass. Since early times, human beings have been trying to understand their surroundings. Early Indian philosophers classified matter in the form of five basic elements -air, earth, fire, sky and water.  </td></tr><tr><td>IX </td><td>2</td><td>Is Matter Around us Pure       </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>Matter can be broadly divided into two major groups, Pure and Impure. In chemistry, the term purity acquires quite a different meaning from what we understand it to be in our day-to-day life. Normally, when we refer to pure water, pure milk, etc., what is implied is that the water, milk etc., are free from harmful substances such as bacteria, fungi, viruses, etc., or are not adulterated. Purity as a chemical concept signifies something quite different. When we say a substance is pure, it means that the constituent particles that make up the substance are of only one type and have the same chemical nature. </td></tr><tr><td>IX </td><td>3</td><td>Atoms & Molecules   </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>When scientists started exploring matter, they realised that matter can be divided into smaller and still smaller particles. What was the ultimate particle like? They discovered that the smallest particle of an element that maintains its chemical identity through all chemical and physical changes is called and atom. John Dalton (1766 - 1844) can rightly be called the father of the Modern Theory on Atoms. He proposed his Atomic Theory in 1808, i.e., almost 200 years back. He did not have the help of sophisticated instruments that are available today to the scientists. Hence, many of his proposals, have been modified and updated. Over the years, substantial changes have taken place regarding the atomic theory, yet some of the assumptions that Dalton made are still held valid. </td></tr><tr><td>IX </td><td>4</td><td>Structure of the Atom    </td>
					<td>0 </td><td>Atoms and molecules are the fundamental building blocks of matter. The existence of different
kinds of matter is due to different atoms constituting them. Now the questions arise: (i) What makes the atom of one element different from the atom of another element? and (ii) Are atoms really indivisible, as proposed by Dalton, or are there smaller constituents inside the atom? sub-atomic particles and the various models that have been proposed to explain how these particles are arranged within the atom. The elucidation of the structure of atoms is based on a series of experiments. One of the first indications that atoms are not indivisible, comes from studying static electricity and the condition under which electricity is conducted by different substances.
