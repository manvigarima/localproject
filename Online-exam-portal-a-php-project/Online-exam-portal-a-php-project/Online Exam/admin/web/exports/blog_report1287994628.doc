					<tr><td style='padding-left:5px;'><p>During exam lime students get stressful, anxious and worried as the time length is gradually converging towards theboard exams followed by the engineering entrance exams soon after.The purpose of the board exams is to check the subject knowledge and conceptual strength of the student at the wider level. In the home exam the makers of the paper are the teachers who teach you in the class so the papers reflect the same philosophy and the content as done in the class. While the board exams&acirc;&euro;&trade; paper include the philoso&Acirc;&not;phy and content of various experienced teachers which may appear to be different then what you have done in your class. To score very high in such an exam the general&Acirc;&not;isation of your knowledge and concepts is an essential. All the engineering entrance exams are held a short while after the XII Board exams are over. So. the limited time length available is an obvious and biggest of all constraints.</p> </td></tr>
