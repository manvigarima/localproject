UNIREST
--> Many developer using PHP environment on Windows (such as WAMP) reported problem :
Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'Exception' with message 'SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate' in \Unirest\Request.php on line 475

Some dev environment can't manage SSL verfication, so we turned off the SSL verifier of Unirest.

File modified is : assets\vendor\mashape\unirest-php\src\Unirest\Request.php
Around line 442 :
changed :
//CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER => self::$verifyPeer,
by:
CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER => false,
