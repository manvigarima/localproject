Start Booking calendar plugin helps you schedule and book online appointments from your WordPress website.

== WordPress Calendar Booking ==

Start Booking is a WordPress calendar for booking that is focused on helping individuals and businesses manage customers, book more appointments, and sell more services.

This plugin will seamlessly connect with the Start Booking online service where you can display an optimized booking calendar anywhere on your WordPress site and drive your users to book appointments directly from your own domain. The plugin has been developed to adopt and inherit your WordPress theme styles, so minimal (if any) updates are needed to give your website a performant and professional looking booking calendar.

With the Start Booking calendar plugin you will find a nice balance between the appointment booking tools available to you straight from the WordPress admin and what’s available within the Start Booking app itself. From our experience, most businesses don’t want to run the day-day of their business directly within their WordPress admin. Because of this, the team focused on developing the Start Booking [scheduling software](https://www.startbooking.com/) which is focused on helping you manage your appointments and business better while leveraging your WordPress website as a tool and integrated part of the experience.

== Managing booking calendar ==

Once the plugin is installed and setup, there are two easy ways to manage where you display your calendar and what the booking experience will be like. 

The first and most popular option is to place the `[startbooking]` shortcode on whatever page or post you want the full online booking experience to be displayed. This shortcode will display a monthly calendar with the available times per day.

The second calendar booking option is to use `[startbooking_cta services="siGORMb0" ]Button Text[/startbooking_cta]` shortcode. This shortcode will display a button to book the specified service listed in the shortcode. Upon click, the user will be brought to a calendar to select a day and time for their appointment. This shortcode allows for two different options. First, you can change the button text by simply replacing the “Button Text” between the two brackets. Secondly, you can add multiple service ID’s (comma separated) to have a bundle of services preselected for booking appointments.

Some additional options include the ability to change the booking button background and text colors so they better match the look of your online calendar.
